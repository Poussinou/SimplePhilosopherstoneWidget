What are Philospherstones?

PhilosopherStone is a cryptocurrency that provides an annual stake rate of 50% (64% Compounded), or 3.44% monthly, for keeping the stones in your wallet (POS).
Reward halving on September 2019 to 25% and on September 2021 to 12,5%.
You will receive additional stones as reward "for free" if you do not move your stones for more than ~8.8 Days.
(Time can be longer if your total stake weight [=amount of stones x time] compared to the network weight is low [see green dot on the lower right of your wallet])

- high profit (50% p.a.): even at constant coin price due to high annual stake rate
- fair:                   no pre-mine, No IPOs, No ICOs   (The intial distribution took 10 months with Proof-of-Work Scrypt algorithm before Scrypt ASICs.)
- environmental friendly: green minting instead of mining (Proof-of-stake algorithm guaranties low power consumption and operating costs for minters.)
- fast transactions:      200 sec block time
- transaction messages
- Coin Control Feature:   user can manually select input adresses for sending PHS (e.g. for no loosing to much stake weight)
- running since 2013!:    Launched 27 of July 2013
- and much more
